# Informative-Python-Compiler-Error-Messages

#A program to use StackOverflow.com submissions to supply a more informative 
#compiler error message for the user, rather than the already present difficult python compiler's provided message.

#The data used in this project is FinalQuestions.csv and FinalAnswers.csv, every other file used will be created through the program.

#In order to use this code first run the Traceback code, and when prompted write an erroneous code 
#Next using the Tf-Idf and Cosine similarity method simply run the code, and lastly run the last method, Return Answers
#to have the new compiler error message print out as to how to fix the erroneous code
